API TESTING Using Robot framework
Step1: Steup Python  - Python 3 version
Step2: Steup Pycharm - Python code + Robot Testcase
Step3: Setup intellibot Plugin (support for writing robot TC)
Step4: Configure PIP
Step5: Install robotframework-requests and it's dependencies via pip
- pip install robotframework
- pip install -U requests
- pip install -U robotframework-requests 
Step6: Install robotframework-jsonlibrary
1. pip install jsonpath_rw
2. pip install jsonpath_rw_ext
3. pip install robotframework-jsonlibrary
4. pip install /Users/jimbi/Downloads/robotframework-jsonlibrary-master

How to use in project: Install robotmetrics

Case 1: Using pip

pip install robotframework-metrics

Case 2: Using setup.py (clone project and run command within root)

python setup.py install

Execute robotmetrics command to generate report

Case 1: No change in output.xml, log.html file name's and user is in same folder robotmetrics

Case 2: Change in output.xml, log.html file name's And .xml and .html files are under 'Result' folder robotmetrics --inputpath ./Result/ --output "output1.xml" --log "log1.html"

For more info on command line options use:

robotmetrics --help

RobotFramework Metrics Report metric-timestamp.html file will be created in current folder | -inputpath if specified

Email will be sent to mentioned recepient with metric-timestamp.html file

Customize Report Specify Logo in Robotframework metrics:

Custom Logo : Customize your logo by using --logo command line option

--logo "https://mycompany/logo.jpg"

How to Specifiy EMAIL recepients Default robotmetrics uses gmail server. From command line users have to specific FROM, PWD, TO and CC

robotmetrics --email true --from "user1@gmail.com" --pwd "***********" --to "user2@gmail.com,user3@yahoo.com" --cc "user4@yahoo.com,user5@gmail.com"

From 3.1.2: -E or --email in command line is considered as true

(3.1.2 is in developement - can get by cloning master)

robotmetrics --email --from "user1@gmail.com" --pwd "***********" --to "user2@gmail.com,user3@yahoo.com" --cc "user4@yahoo.com,user5@gmail.com"

How to Disable EMAIL By default email will be sent to mentioned recipients when robotmetrics command is executed. Using --email false can disable email

robotmetrics --email false How to Ignore Library Keywords in Metrics Report Use command line options to ignore library keywords --ignore "Collections,Selenium2Library" In Metric report, keywords with type value 'for' and 'foritem' are ignored Following library keywords are ignored in Metrics Report ignore_library = [ 'BuiltIn', 'SeleniumLibrary', 'String', 'Collections', 'DateTime', ] Generate robotframework-metrics after execution Execute robotmetrics command after suite or test execution as follows:

Create .bat (or) .sh file with following snippet

robot test.robot && robotmetrics [:options] && is used to execute multiple command's in .bat file

Modify robotmetrics command as required and execute .bat file

Robotframework metrics will be created after execution

*Performance Improvement (Beta) *

Do you feel robotmetrics command taking more time to capture metrics? Robotframework-metrics have ability to process metrics in parallel using gevent (which helps in saving time) Step 1: Install gevent Step 2: Execute robotmetrics command
